Krix Gif Viewer
=========
So this mess I produced is the product of me being fed up with using my browser to open the .gif format,
not being able to browse my entire folder at ease and not finding a program that fit my needs.

YOU CAN:
-Load multiple files (Open With..).
-Load entire folders by dragging it into the .exe (aka the command line supports folders).
-Use Drag'n'Drop to load files and folders.
-Use the left and right arrow keys to browse through your entire folder.

YOU CANNOT:
-Open another image by double-clicking it while an instance is already active.
 >The shenanigans required to give the first instance the arguments 
 >of the second instance was something I couldn't be bothered doing, sorry.
-Browse your Folders inside of the program.
